# Machine Learning Security Evasion Competition 2022
## Introduction
The [Machine Learning Security Evasion Competition (MLSEC) 2022](https://mlsec.io/) took place from August 12th to September 23th 2022 and was organized by [Adversa AI](https://adversa.ai/), [CUJO AI](https://cujo.com/), and [Robust Intelligence](https://www.robustintelligence.com/).
This was for me the first security comptetition tageting ML systems and so I was very motivated to take part in it. Overall, such competitions are great opportunities to do practice, meet new people and, why not, try to win the first prize :).
By the way, I took part in the Anti-Phishing Evasion challenge and achieved the first place.
In the follow, I will first introduce the challenge and then explain my solution.

## Anti-Phishing Evasion challenge
The goal of the challenge was to manipulate 10 phishing web pages (HTML files) in order to evade 8 ML models (for a total of 80 points), which have been designed to classify phishing web pages. A ML model is considered evaded if the returned output probability score (of being a phishing sample) is lower than `0.1`. The challenge had an additional constraint: the manipulated web page must be rendered in the same way as the original one. In practice, this means that the screenshots of the (rendered) manipulated and original web page must have the same (SHA-256) hash.

## Solution
The core idea behind the solution is: starting from the original phishing web page, manipulate it by injecting some HTML elements such that the classification scores returned by the ML classifiers is below the threshold (i.e., the ML models are evaded). The new manipulated web page can be considered an _adversarial example_ for the target ML models.
This approach is similar to the one adopted to evade ML-based malware detectors (see [Adversarial EXEmple by Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07125)). It basically consists in defining:
- a set of manipulations that represent how to manipulate an input sample. It is important to point out that such manipulations must be functionality-preserving, that is they must preserve the original behavior/semantic (for example, in our case the manipulated web page must be successfully rendered as the original one).
- a strategy (also known as "optimizer") that specifies how to apply the manipulations.

### **Manipulations**
Considering our problem, the manipulations are represented by the injection of HTML elements. So, **the main point to address was finding successful manipulations, that is manipulations to which the ML models are sensitive. Such manipulations can be exploited in order to evade the ML model**.
Unfortunately, when working with data like malware (PE files) or web pages (HTML files), the set of possible manipulations is quite huge (i.e., the input space is very big) and usually an extensive testing is needed.
Anyway, after experimenting a bit by trying several HTML elements, I found out that adding several `<input>` tags of certain types such as `text`, `submit`, `radio`, `search` and `button` in the body of the web page allowed me to decrease the classification score below the threshold.
However, the addition of such `<input>` tags causes the manipulated web page to have a different rendering, thus violating the constraint of the challenge.
To solve this issue, the added `<input>` tags can be embedded into `<noscript></noscript>`. In this way, everything included in `<noscript></noscript>` is basically ignored (I verified that the sandbox hosted for the challenge had a Web browser with JS enabled).
Using this approach, the ML models are still sensitive to the injected HTML tags. So, considering the results (returned scores) obtained during testing, we can conclude that:
- the above HTML tags are used (in some way) in the feature extraction phase and affect the decision of the ML models.  
- the ML models do not check whether the injected HTML tags are nested into `<noscript></noscript>`. 

Moreover, by performing further testing I also found out additional manipulations that resulted effective in decreasing the classification score:
- Changing the type of `password` `<input>` tags to `text` (like in `<input type="password" .../>` ‚ü∂ `<input type="text" .../>`).
- Adding random JS code nested in `<noscript></noscript>` into the `<head></head>` and `<body></body>` of the sample web pages.
- Moving the CSS code from `<head></head>` to `<body></body>` (useful for those web pages with a lot of CSS code in `<head></head>`).

### **Strategy**
The strategy used to solve the challenge is based on 3 main steps that repeat until the current web page evades the target ML classifiers:
1. Select an HTML tag (for example from a given set) and inject it into the web page.
2. Ensure that the rendering is preserved.
3. Get the classification scores (one for each ML model) through the API provided by the competition as feedback (reward):
   - If the scores are decreased, as for the next HTML tag to be selected, we can either choose an HTML tags of the same type (to check whether increasing the number of the previously added tags futher reduces the scores) or try a different type.  
   - Otherwise, it means that the added HTML element is not effective in decreasing the scores. So, remove it and try a new one of a different type.  
Moreover, in this competition I found particularly useful to inject some copies of the same tag instead of a single one to speed up the evasion.

From an implementation point of view, the above approach can be implemented through a fuzzer that iteratively tries injecting different types of HTML tags, as well as keeps track of the returned scores in order to decide whether to keep the injected tag or to remove it. If implementing the fuzzer in Python, the HTML page can be easily manipulated using [beautifulsoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

Finally, in order to check whether the rendering is preserved, I used the following Python script, which makes use of [html2image](https://github.com/vgalin/html2image) to take a screenshot when rendering a web page:
```python
import os
import hashlib
from PIL import Image
from html2image import Html2Image

adversarial_pages_path = os.path.abspath(".")
phising_files_path = os.path.abspath("..")

def check_rendering(selected_samples=None, remove_screenshots=False):
    hti = Html2Image()
    if selected_samples is not None:
        assert(isinstance(selected_samples, list) and 1 <= len(selected_samples) <= 10 and
               all([1 <= s <= 10 for s in selected_samples]))
    files_idx = selected_samples if selected_samples is not None else list(range(1, 11))
    check_list = ['{:02d}'.format(idx) for idx in files_idx]

    for img_name in check_list:
        # save a screenshot of both the original and modified web pages
        hti.screenshot(html_file=os.path.join(phising_files_path, img_name + '.html'),
                       save_as=img_name + '.png')
        hti.screenshot(html_file=os.path.join(adversarial_pages_path, img_name + '.html'),
                       save_as=img_name + '_adv.png')

        # compute the SHA-256 hashes
        hash_original = hashlib.sha256(Image.open(img_name + '.png').tobytes()).hexdigest()
        hash_adv = hashlib.sha256(Image.open(img_name + '_adv.png').tobytes()).hexdigest()

        if hash_original == hash_adv:
            print("The original html and the generated adversarial example " +
                  "have the same rendering!\n")
        else:
            print("The original html and the generated adversarial example do NOT " +
                  "have the same rendering!.\nDifferent SHA256 hashes: " +
                  "{}\n{}\n".format(hash_original, hash_adv))

        if remove_screenshots:
            os.remove(img_name + '.png')
            os.remove(img_name + '_adv.png')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # check_rendering()
    # pass a list of intgers (from 1 to 10) to select specific web pages
    check_rendering(selected_samples=[1, 3, 8])
```
